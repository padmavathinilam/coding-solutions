## Problem

### AVG()

Listen

The AVG() function is used to calculate the  **Average**  of values within a specific column.

Below is the query to find the Average Age from the table customer.

```
SELECT AVG(Age)
FROM customer;

```

### Task

Write a query to find the Average of the column 'Payout' from the table 'employee'.
Rename the column header as 'avg_payout'.
Code it out in the IDE.

```
Expected output
┌─────────────┐
│ avg_payout  │
├─────────────┤
│ 15.5339     │
└─────────────┘

```
