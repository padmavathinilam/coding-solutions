## Problem

### SELECT Query

Listen

As you saw in the problem earlier, the  **Flights**  table had the following information in columns

- Passenger_id with datatype INT
- Passenger_name with datatype VARCHAR
- Gender with datatype VARCHAR
- Origin with datatype VARCHAR
- Destination with datatype VARCHAR

To view data entries in specific columns of a table, the following syntax is used

```
    select column_1, column_2
    from Flights;

```

To view  **ALL**  rows of a table, the following syntax is used

```
    select *
    from Flights;

```

### Task

Write a query which does the following

- Let us fetch the entry specifically from 2 columns - 'Passenger_name' and 'Gender'.

```
Expected output
┌────────────────┬────────┐
│ Passenger_name │ Gender │
├────────────────┼────────┤
│ Jackson        │ Male   │
│ Riya           │ Female │
│ Roy            │ Male   │
│ Anthony        │ Male   │
│ Salim          │ Male   │
│ Dia            │ Female │
│ Jackson        │ Male   │
│ Dia            │ Female │
│ Riya           │ Female │
│ Betty          │ Female │
└────────────────┴────────┘

```

Code it out in the IDE.
